Over the years, I have poured countless hours into finding the perfect system for managing my Linux dotfiles. Although each attempt taught me important lessons about organization, but none satisfied me.

But now, I am going to try again. I am going to set up this repo as a monorepo (except the wallpapers and fonts) and use it to manage all my dotfiles.

To those who used my repo as a base, I am truly sorry. Hopefully this time, I will learn from my previous experience and finally get it right.
